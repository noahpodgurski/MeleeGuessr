# MeleeGuessr

Think you can really guess who's playing that captain falcon - based solely off the movement? Now's your chance! Visit [MeleeGuessr](https://www.MeleeGuessr.com) and play now!

### TODOS ###
1. ~~Scoring & Leaderboard~~
2. Guess the controller! (Clips of fox/marth/pikachu), guess if classic or box controller
3. Optimizations: 
    
    a. What else can we strip from .slp file? (player input maybe? Other game settings not necessary? Any data transfer saved would save $$$)
    
    b. Look again at stripping beginning from slp (probably not possible (?) unless player states could be saved (which *probabbllyyy* takes up >= space))
4. ~~Make more character-diverse combos (current clip state:)~~
